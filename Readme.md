# OOAD Project

# Overview

The healthcare industry stands on the brink of transformation, driven by blockchain technology's potential to reshape patient care, data management, and research collaboration. This innovative project aims to harness the power of blockchain to address several pressing challenges in healthcare, while empowering patients with ownership of their health data and ensuring secure, transparent, and interoperable medical record systems.

# Project Idea

## MediLockerðŸ”’

Leveraging blockchain technology in the medical industry can lead to innovative solutions to
address various challenges wherein patients can have ownership of their health data, and
different healthcare providers can access and update the records with the patient's
consent. This can ensure efficient data processing and storing and accessing medical records
whilst building a secure and interoperable medical record system on the blockchain.

We intend to incorporate the following features to whatever extent possible :

- A decentralised platform for clinical trials which can increase transparency and
accountability in the process, making it easier for patients to participate and researchers
to access accurate data.
- Develop a decentralised prescription management system that tracks prescription
issuance, refills, and usage which can help prevent prescription fraud and drug abuse
while ensuring patients have access to their medications.
- Implement a blockchain-based system that rewards participants for contributing their
health data to medical research studies.
- Develop a transparent and tamper-resistant organ transplant registry on the blockchain
that can facilitate the registration process and ensure the accuracy of organ matching
and availability.
- The system aims to ensure secure and transparent issuance of prescription drugs. Doctors will upload the specific drug and quantity to be issued, which can be verified by users from a verified pharmacy. This can prevent fake medical prescriptions. The system can also track the usage of drugs.

### Clinical Trials

- It includes a decentralised platform to storing all clinical trial reports and verified clinics.
- The report of a particular clinical trial can be used by a different doctor or hospital without repeating the test, as it would be a verified report hosted on decentralized network ensuring transparency.
- This will also be used to maintain all the trial reports in a proper timeline, so that they can be later referred for verification of medical history or medical complications. As this is a decentralized network and transparent the medical history we retrieve from here will be reliable and canâ€™t be faked.

### Prescription

- Prescription can be securely stored on the blockchain-based system which can be accessed by the patient and authorized healthcare providers.
- If a patient visits a new doctor, the new doctor can refer to the old prescription stored on the blockchain to understand the treatment received by the patient, which can lead to better care and outcomes.

### Organ Transplant

- The organ transplant registry will be stored on the blockchain, ensuring that all records are tamper-resistant and transparent.
- The registry will facilitate the registration process for organ donors and recipients, making it easier for them to connect and match.
- The accuracy of organ matching and availability will be ensured by the use of the blockchain, which can provide a secure and reliable record of the status of each organ.
- The registry will also allow for the tracking of the organ transplant process, including the monitoring of the organ's condition and the success of the transplant.
- The use of money power and contacts will be reduced as the information will be available on blockchain and will be transparent. So, the patient who apploed earlier will receive the organ first.

### Prescription Drugs

- The system will facilitate the process of issuing drugs by ensuring that doctors upload the specific drug and quantity to be issued to the user.
- Users can then verify the issuance of the drug from a verified pharmacy, ensuring that no one can fake a medical prescription to obtain the drug.
- The system can track the usage of the drug, including the amount and the person to whom it was sold, to prevent prescription fraud and drug abuse.
- This will also enable better monitoring of patient drug use, which can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about the patient's treatment plan and improve patient outcomes.

### Patient Data for study

- The data of the patient can be used for medical studies and research.
- But we should ensure that the data used by institutes is verified and the remuneration and rewards for using data is received by the patient.
- The blockchain based system ensures this reliability and transparency
